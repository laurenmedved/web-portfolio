                    <p>The goal of this project was to create an early education website that is accesible for children. My inspiration for this project was my two nephews, Kayhon and Eli. Both of them are toddlers who love everything related to building and construction. My concept became â€˜Structured Education.' a place where children can build a foundation in learning.

                    <h1>Branding</h1>
                    <p> The branding that I created for Structured Education revolved around three colors, green, red, and yellow. The intent behind choosing these colors was to make it easier for children to recognize positive and negative concepts. Although I did not make any functioning games for this website, I had the concept that children would get green, yellow, and red messages depending on how they performed in the games. I also chose these colors because they're often seen throughout construction, such as with signage. In addition to these three colors, I added a warm gray to be a neutral color. 
                    <p>
                    Along with these colors, I made a few textures that represented construction concepts, such as caution tape and steel beams. These textures are meant to add subsistence to basic designs throughout the website. 
                    <p>
                    Finally, the branding also included this idea of being encapsulated in signs. I made the main logo appear to be a sign, and I also attempted to make many sections throughout the website look like signs.
